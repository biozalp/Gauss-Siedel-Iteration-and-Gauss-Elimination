Warning:
- Due to the limitations given by the assignment, one must enter a coefficient matrix larger or equal to a 10x10 matrix.
- Due to the nature of these methods, C should be the same lenght of A matrix in terms of rows. Otherwise the code will not work.
- The script is written in Python 3. Eventhough it might work flawlessly in Python2.7 , python3 running procedure is highly recommended.
- Before running the script, make sure to run 'pip3 install requirements.txt' in order to install the required packages.

Usage:
'python3 main.py'
